# Easy Lyf - IEEE Competition

## About Competition
This project was developed as part of IEEE competition 2024, where the challenge was to design and build a visually appealing **Smart Home Control Center** within a 3-hour timeframe. Our team, consisting of myself and <a href="https://github.com/Hitesh-PSG" target="_blank">Hitesh P</a>, participated in this competition. The first hour was to design the prototype on Figma, and the following 2 hours were dedicated to building it.

The goal was to create a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring smart home devices

## About Project
Our project, **Easy Lyf** is a front-end web solution designed with a strong emphasis on creating an engaging UI/UX.

Built under competition time constraints, the website isn't fully responsive and certain sections need further refinement for better appeal.
